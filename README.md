# Gator Locator (UF_Geoguesser)
This mobile application is aimed towards freshman having trouble finding their way around campus.

This is a simple quiz app that will show you a picture of a building and you have to determine what building it is.

# Future Work
I hope to implement Google maps API to incorporate street view.

For now we use Firebase to store pictues of places around campus and insert them into the quiz.
